# Anonymokata

## Github anonymizer, allowing for kata reviews without concern of author

This script will allow any github repository to be cloned, scrubbed (removing all references to 
username and email), creating new repository within organization account and pushing the 'cleaned'
code to new repository.

1. clone this repository. (this will be the 'anon' directory) - [anonymokata](https://github.com/ddaugher/anonymokata)
2. change directory, to the directory where you want to clone the candidate repository.
3. execute the anonymizer script...

```
	[anon directory]/anon.sh
```

4. answer the questions.
5. you are done.
